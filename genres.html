        <h1>Evolution of Anime over Time: Genres</h1>
        <p id="msg">
            The breadth of subjects and themes in anime is undoubtedly one of its strengths. Animes span varied genres from dramatic epics on 
            war and politics to lighthearted comedies about daily life, from complex concepts like time travel and the paranormal to seemingly
            menial ones like sports and high school. <br><br>
            
            While some genres remain mainstays of the industry regardless of the times, such as comedy and action, others come in (and out of) 
            vogue constantly. As with many things, it often takes a few visionaries to break ground in a new genre for it to have a chance of going 
            mainstream. For example, while sports animes have had a strong presence even since the '60s and '70s with works like "Speed Racer" 
            (1967) and "Ashita no Joe" (1970), it was the release of "Captain Tsubasa" in 1983 that really propelled the genre to new heights. In fact, 
            "Captain Tsubasa" had such a cultural impact it is credited with popularizing association football as a whole in Japan, and was named by 
            Zinedine Zidane and Lionel Messi for inspiring them to take up the sport.<br><br>

            Another influence that should be noted is the rise of the internet, which made it easier to audiences to express demand and discover niche 
            genres, and also for creators to more easily distribute their work. It comes as no surprise that the number of animes in less popular 
            genres like school and music exploded in the 2000s, in part due to this effect. <br><br>

            Below we plotted the number of anime released in each genre over time, with each color representing a different genre. The areas are ordered 
            by the total number of animes ever released in that genre, with the most popular genres at the bottom. Hover over individual areas to 
            identify the genre and view other details.<br><br>
