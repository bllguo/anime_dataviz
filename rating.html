        <h1>Evolution of Anime over Time: Content Ratings</h1>
        <p id="msg">
            Even today, animation is often still associated with youth, especially in the Western world. Though indeed most animation
            has been produced for children and teens, this is an incorrect perception, as many animated works have been and 
            continue to be produced targeting adult audiences. Anime films such as "Akira" (1988) and "Ghost in the Shell" (1995) are pivotal 
            works in animation praised for their artistic value and handling of mature themes. <br><br>

            The history of adult animation in Japan stretches further back than "Akira." One of the first successful attempts at introducing 
            a darker tone to anime came in the form of "Lupin III" in 1971, an action comedy inspired by French novelist Maurice Leblanc's 
            fictional gentleman thief, Arsene Lupin. Despite being groundbreaking in bringing adult themes to anime, it is actually more 
            light-hearted than its source material. <br><br>

            Anime has also not shied away from sexual themes. Erotic anime are known in English as "hentai," while in Japan they are more commonly
            referred to as R-18 anime. The first animated films to be rated R-18 in Japan were in the early '70s, but were commercial flops that 
            put a halt to further development in the genre until "Lolita Anime" and "Cream Lemon" in 1984, the latter of which found cult success.

            Below we've plotted all anime up to 2021 in MyAnimeList by air date and MyAnimeList member count (a proxy for its popularity), with 
            points colored by content rating and sized based on user scores (higher scores, larger points). Click each label of the legend to toggle 
            the visibility of the corresponding rating. Hover over individual points to see further details on each anime. Click and drag to pan, 
            and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
