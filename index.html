        <h1>Evolution of Anime over Time: Formats</h1>
        <p id="msg">Japanese animation, or anime, is today a worldwide phenomenon and arguably Japan's leading cultural export. The roots of anime 
            can be traced to films from the early 1900s, but even in Japan it did not reach mainstream popularity until the '80s, after a formative
            period that defined anime's modern conventions starting in the '60s. Anime exploded into the Western world in the '90s, and has seen a 
            meteoric rise since.<br><br>

            Over this period, anime evolved in many different ways, such as format (TV, film, etc.), genre, target audience, and source material.
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020">Using data scraped from MyAnimeList</a>, an online 
            community of anime fans, we will explore some of these dimensions over the history of anime.<br><br>

            One area of innovation in anime has been in format and delivery. While anime started off as movies, they expanded to serialized TV 
            shows in the '60s, led by the popularity of "Astro Boy" in 1963. As demand for anime surged in the 80s and VCRs became commonplace, viewers 
            became willing to buy anime directly from video stores, prompting the rise of original video animations (OVA), which are movies or series 
            released direct-to-video. Noteworthy OVA during this time include the first official OVA release in "Dallos" and commercial hit "Megazone 23." 
            Beginning as standalone releases, today OVA are also released as side stories or exclusive episodes for existing TV anime, or piecemeal as 
            multi-part OVA.<br><br>
            
            With the arrival of the internet, anime expanded to all kinds of other media such as music videos, original net animations (ONA - anime 
            released first on the Web), and video games. ONA began as an accessible format for fan works or independent projects without studio backing,
            but gained more mainstream appeal when major studio AIC released "Mahou Yuugi" on the internet before TV.<br><br>

            Below we've plotted all anime up to 2021 in MyAnimeList by air date and MyAnimeList member count (a proxy for its popularity), with 
            points colored by anime type and sized based on user scores (higher scores, larger points). Click each label of the legend to toggle 
            the visibility of the corresponding rating. Hover over individual points to see further details on each anime. Click and drag to pan, 
            and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
